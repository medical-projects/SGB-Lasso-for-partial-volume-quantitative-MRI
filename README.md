# SGB-Lasso-for-partial-volume-quantitative-MRI
This toolbox includes implementation of the Sparse Group Buerling Lasso (SGB-Lasso) algorithm for the partial-volume (multi-compartment) analysis of the quantitative MRI and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) images.
If you find this toolbox useful for preparing your publication, we kindly request citing the reference article:

M. Golbabaee and C. Poon, "An off-the-grid approach to multi-compartment magnetic resonance fingerprinting", 2020.

Tested on MATLAB_R2019a

Dependencies: This software uses the LBFGS algorithm for nonlinear optimisation. For this you also need to install the LBFGS toolbox and have it in Matlab path while running our software. An implementation of LBFGS can be found in: https://github.com/stephenbeckr/L-BFGS-B-C
